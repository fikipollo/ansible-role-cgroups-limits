#       user can be:
#           - a user name
#           - a group name with @group syntax
#           - the wildcard '*', for any user or group
#           - '%', which is equivalent to "ditto" (useful for
#             multi-line rules where different cgroups need to be
#             specified for various hierarchies for a single user)
